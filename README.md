# mavs.sh

This is a shell script to perform static analysis on mobile applications. Currently it only works for android apk files.
What makes this tool different from all the other tools that do this? My goal with this project is to actually exploit things.
Often you find static analysis tools point to things and say **VULNERABLE!** and the user is left to figure out why. Or worst its a 
false positive. 

This tool has two options currently:
  - -v verbose = Show me why you think its broken (useful for fixing and reporting)
  - -e exploit = Show me how to exploit this so called broken thing. Or show me how to manually check if it is indeed broken. I try
  provide actual commands that can be cut and pasted into the terminal verbatim to demonstrate risk.

## Required Dependencies
```
apkinfo       # sudo apt-get install apkinfo
